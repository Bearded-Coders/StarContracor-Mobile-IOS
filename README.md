# Star Contractor Mobile Application

## What is this?
- This is the mobile version of our star citizen tool used for connecting players of star citizen
- This app is created using React-Native and is currently being developed for IOS, Android to come later more than likely built with Kotlin.
- The mobile version was inspired to be created from a school I am currently in through a VET-TEC program.
- Neither of the creators of star contractor have any experience with React Native so this will be a learning curve and a process to build. 

## How to use
- You don't, this isn't for anyone but the people in The Bearded Coders. I am only keeping this public so my Instructor can see this repo.
- For the people working on this, Just run NPM I at the root of this repository. We have lots of work to do intergrating this into our existing Java Server. The cookie integration will be interesting to say the least using React Native and with our Redis server.

## Extras
- More to come soon, I am super excited to get working on this and deliver this on another platform other than the web
